FIX CLIENT SETUP RULES + FORM SCROLLING + SRD UPPERCASE + DATA EXPORT (ONE PROMPT)

A) CLIENT SETUP RULE: CATEGORY REQUIRED BEFORE DEPARTMENT
1) Block “Create Department” if the selected client has ZERO categories.
2) When user clicks “Add Department” and no categories exist:
   a) Show a clean modal/alert:
      “Create at least 1 CATEGORY before adding Departments. Categories help group Departments for inventory and reporting.”
   b) Add button: “Create Category Now” -> opens Create Category modal/page.
3) Backend enforcement too:
   a) If POST /departments is called when client has no categories, return 400 with the same message.
4) After category is created successfully, auto-refresh and allow department creation immediately.
Do not redesign UI. Just enforce this rule + friendly prompt.

B) UI FIX: MAKE ITEM CREATE/EDIT FORMS SCROLLABLE
Problem: Item Create/Edit forms can’t reach the last sections on smaller screens.
Fix:
1) Wrap the form body in a scroll container:
   a) set a max-height (e.g., 70vh or calc(100vh - header/footer))
   b) enable overflow-y:auto
2) Keep footer actions (Save/Cancel) sticky or always visible at the bottom.
3) Apply to BOTH:
   a) Create Item form modal
   b) Edit Item form modal
No layout redesign. Just add scrolling + ensure buttons remain accessible.

C) SRD NAME AUTO-UPPERCASE (LINK OR CREATE SRD FORM)
1) On the “Link or Create SRD” form, for the “Create New SRD” name input:
   a) convert user typing to UPPERCASE live (onChange -> value.toUpperCase()).
2) Backend enforcement:
   a) sanitize SRD name to UPPERCASE again on create/update so lowercase can never be stored.
3) Apply ONLY to SRD Name field (do not affect other fields unless already required).

D) DATA EXPORT & BACKUP: MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL (TENANT-SAFE)
In Settings → Data Export & Backup:
1) Implement export buttons that actually work and download files.
2) Export MUST be scoped to the logged-in organizationId/tenant only (no cross-tenant data).
3) Provide export options:
   A) Export to Excel (XLSX)
   B) Export to CSV (ZIP if multiple files)
4) Include at minimum these datasets:
   - Clients
   - Departments + Categories
   - Items + Suppliers
   - Purchases/GRN
   - Sales Captures + Declared Payments
   - SRD Ledgers + Counts
   - Exceptions + Receivables + Surplus Registers
5) Add date range filter (default: last 30 days) + custom range.
6) Backend:
   a) Create /api/export endpoint(s) that generate file and return as attachment download.
   b) For larger exports, use streaming or chunking but MUST still return a working download.
7) UI:
   a) show progress state (“Preparing export…”)
   b) show success (“Download started”)
   c) show error message if export fails
Do not redesign the Settings page; only make the existing export actions functional.

E) REQUIRED OUTPUT (FOR VERIFICATION)
1) List exact file paths edited.
2) For each edited file, print first 10–15 lines to confirm correct file.
3) Provide code patches with clear START/END markers.
4) Provide a quick test checklist:
   - cannot create department without at least 1 category
   - item create/edit forms scroll and Save button reachable
   - SRD name saves in uppercase (frontend + backend)
   - data export downloads correct tenant data and respects date range
