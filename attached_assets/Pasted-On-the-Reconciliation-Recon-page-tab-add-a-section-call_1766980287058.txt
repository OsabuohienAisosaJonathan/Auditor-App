On the Reconciliation (Recon) page/tab, add a section called “Department Comparison (2nd Hit)” that shows BOTH variances.
Table Columns (exact order)
Department | Total Captured | Total Declared | Audit (Dep) | Variance 1 (System − Audit) | Variance 2 (Declared − Audit) | Status
Data Sources (must be exact)
1.	Total Captured and Total Declared must be fetched per department from Reported Payments Summary:
o	Total Captured = captured/system/book sales total for the department
o	Total Declared = declared cash + declared POS + declared transfer for the department
2.	Audit (Dep) must be pulled per department from SRD Department Store for the same client/date and calculated as:
o	Audit (Dep) = Σ( Sold Qty × Selling Price ) for all items in that department SRD for that day
o	Use SRD saved values (Amount Sold / Value Sold) if already computed.
Variance Calculations (both required)
•	Variance 1 (System − Audit) = Total Captured − Audit (Dep)
•	Variance 2 (Declared − Audit) = Total Declared − Audit (Dep)
Status Rules (simple + clear)
•	If Audit (Dep) is missing/zero → Awaiting Audit
•	If Var1 < 0 and Var2 < 0 → Sales Missing + Cash Shortage
•	If Var1 < 0 and Var2 ≥ 0 → Sales Missing (System Under-captured)
•	If Var1 ≥ 0 and Var2 < 0 → Cash Shortage (Under-remittance)
•	If Var1 ≥ 0 and Var2 ≥ 0 → Balanced/Excess
Footer Totals
Add a TOTAL row at the bottom:
TOTAL | ΣCaptured | ΣDeclared | ΣAudit | ΣVar1 | ΣVar2 | —
Matching + Filters (critical)
•	Match by departmentId (not department name)
•	Filter by selected client + selected audit date (and outlet if applicable)
Display
•	Format currency with ₦ and show negative values clearly (e.g., -₦12,500)
•	Keep it clean and professional.
PROMPT ADD-ON (Exceptions + Receivables + Surplus):
1.	In the Department Comparison (2nd Hit) table:
a) If Status = Short, show button “Create Receivable”.
b) If Status = Excess, show button “Log Surplus”.
2.	Clicking either button creates a record under Exceptions module, but stored separately as:
a) Receivables Register (Short)
b) Surplus Register (Excess)
3.	The existing Raise Exception form remains for all other cases not strictly Short/Excess.
4.	Both Receivables and Surplus records must be revisitable and support status updates and history:
o	Receivables: Open, Part Paid, Settled, Written Off
o	Surplus: Open, Classified, Cleared/Posted
5.	Each record must save: client, department, audit date, variance amount, comments, evidence attachment, and audit trail log.
