GOAL
Implement a professional subscription system with:
1) Monthly / Quarterly / Yearly billing views
2) Plan-based feature gating (VIEW vs DOWNLOAD)
3) Hard limits per plan: Client/Company slots, SRD Department Store count, user seats, data retention
4) Admin controls: platform admin can manage plans, subscriptions, upgrades/downgrades, suspend accounts

STRICT RULES
1) Do NOT break existing AuditOps functionality.
2) Do NOT rename or delete existing routes/tables.
3) Add new schema/tables only when necessary.
4) Locked features must be visible but restricted using “Preview Mode – Upgrade to Download” (watermark).
5) SRD Ledger logic must NOT be altered or distorted.

========================================================
B) PLANS (FEATURES + LIMITS)
Adjust, update and Create plans: Starter, Growth, Business, Enterprise.

   - maxMainStorePerClient = 1
   - maxSeats = 5 users
   - retentionDays = 90
   - Reports: download/print allowed EXCEPT:
     * 2nd Hit page + full table download: locked (preview only)
     * SRD Main Store Ledger Summary download: locked
   - Purchases Register page: allowed only if you decide; default: allowed in Growth ONLY IF desired.
     (If not, keep Purchases Register Business+ only.)

========================================================
C) SUBSCRIPTION DATA MODEL + ENFORCEMENT
Add a subscription table (additive only) e.g. subscriptions:
- id
- tenantId
- planName (starter|growth|business|enterprise)
- billingPeriod (monthly|quarterly|yearly)
- slotsPurchased (1|3|5|10|custom)
- status (trial|active|past_due|suspended|cancelled)
- startDate, endDate
- createdAt

Also create a derived “entitlements” object computed on login:
- maxClients
- maxSrdDepartmentsPerClient
- maxMainStorePerClient
- maxSeats
- retentionDays
- canViewReports
- canDownloadReports
- canPrintReports
- canAccessPurchasesRegisterPage
- canAccessSecondHitPage
- canDownloadSecondHitFullTable
- canDownloadMainStoreLedgerSummary
- canUseBetaFeatures

Store entitlements on server (computed) and also expose via:
GET /api/subscription/entitlements

========================================================
D) ENFORCEMENT POINTS (MUST IMPLEMENT)
1) Client/Company creation:
   - Block creating more than allowed slots.
   - Show modal: “Limit reached. Upgrade to add more clients/companies.”

2) SRD Department Store creation:
   - Block creating more than plan limit per client.
   - Main store fixed to max 1.

3) User seats:
   - Block inviting/creating more users than allowed.
   - Provide upgrade CTA.

4) Data retention:
   - On reports/audit trail queries, enforce date range:
     * Starter cannot pull older than 30 days, Growth 90 days, etc.
   - UI should show: “Your plan retains data for X days.”

5) Report downloads/prints:
   - All plans can VIEW reports.
   - When user tries to DOWNLOAD/PRINT a locked report:
     * Show upgrade modal
     * Do NOT generate PDF/Excel
     * Add watermark on preview: “Preview Mode – Upgrade to Download”
   - If allowed, generate PDF/Excel normally.

6) Department Comparison (2nd Hit) gating:
   - If plan cannot access 2nd hit page:
     * show a preview card/summary, but block full page route.
   - If plan can view but cannot download:
     * allow full page, block export.

========================================================
E) PLATFORM ADMIN (MIEMPLOYA CONTROL PANEL)
Create a separate Platform Admin area (protected role) for Miemploya:
1) Manage Tenants:
   - view tenant list, accountType, organizationName, plan, status
   - suspend/activate accounts
2) Manage Subscriptions:
   - upgrade/downgrade plan
   - change slot count
   - set status (active, suspended)
3) Audit log of admin actions.

Bootstrap:
- Create initial Platform Super Admin via one-time /setup-platform-admin
- Disable the setup route after creation.

========================================================
F) PRICING PAGE UI (HOME PAGE)
1) Add pricing section with a toggle:
   - Monthly | Quarterly | Yearly
2) Cards: Starter, Growth, Business, Enterprise
3) Show:
   - price per period
   - slots selector: 1, 3, 5, 10 (updates price)
   - highlight “Most Popular” (Growth or Business)
4) CTA:
   - Start Trial / Subscribe / Upgrade
5) Add “How to use MiAuditOps” intro video section on home page.

========================================================
G) OUTPUT REQUIRED (AI BUILDER)
1) Show exact file paths edited/created.
2) For each edited file, print first 10–15 lines to confirm correct file.
3) Provide schema migration steps for new subscription tables.
4) Provide test checklist:
   - signup company vs auditor changes sidebar label
   - SRD dept creation blocked after limit
   - user invite blocked after seat limit
   - retention restriction enforced
   - report preview works for all plans
   - report download blocked/allowed correctly
   - admin can suspend tenant and tenant loses access
PROMPT TO AI BUILDER: HOMEPAGE PRICING PLAN CARDS COPY (REAL SaaS STYLE) + TOGGLE + SLOT SELECTOR + LOCKED FEATURES UI

GOAL
Update the Home page Pricing section so it reads like a premium SaaS product.
You must implement:
1) Pricing section header copy
2) Billing toggle: Monthly / Quarterly / Yearly (with discount badges)
3) Slot selector: 1, 3, 5, 10 (with volume discount note)
4) Four plan cards (Starter, Growth, Business, Enterprise) using the exact copy below
5) Locked-feature UI: show locked items muted with a lock icon and tooltip “Preview Mode – Upgrade to Download”
6) “Most Popular” badge on Growth
7) CTA buttons and secondary links per plan

STRICT RULES
1) Do NOT change existing site layout outside the pricing section.
2) Do NOT remove existing CSS/components—only extend or replace the pricing section component.
3) Keep design professional and modern: clean spacing, clear typography, consistent card height.
4) Do NOT hardcode currencies into random places; use the app’s currency formatter (₦ for NGN default).
