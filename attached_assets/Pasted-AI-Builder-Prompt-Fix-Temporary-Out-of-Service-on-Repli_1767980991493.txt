AI Builder Prompt: Fix “Temporary Out of Service” on Replit (Public Server Binding)
This application (MiAuditOps) is hosted on Replit, and the domain is also managed inside Replit.
The app intermittently shows “Temporary Out of Service”, even though there is no traffic and only one tester. This indicates the server is not publicly bound or is failing Replit health checks.
Your task is to fully remove any localhost-only configuration and make the server publicly accessible on Replit.
1) Audit server binding (MANDATORY)
Search the entire codebase for any usage of:
localhost
127.0.0.1
explicit host arguments in listen() or server start logic
framework defaults that bind locally (Node, Express, Fastify, Next.js custom server, etc.)
List all files where host/interface binding is defined.
2) Remove localhost binding completely
For every server start configuration:
A. Remove any binding to:
localhost
127.0.0.1
B. Replace with public binding:
0.0.0.0
OR remove the host argument entirely so Replit defaults to public binding
C. Ensure the server listens on:
process.env.PORT (Replit-provided port)
No hard-coded ports remain
3) Ensure Replit public exposure compatibility
A. Confirm the app listens on all network interfaces
B. Ensure no logic restricts access to:
owner
internal IPs
local network C. Remove or disable any testing-only guards, IP checks, or environment blocks.
4) Prevent Replit health-check failures
A. Ensure the server starts immediately and responds to requests
B. Add (or confirm) a lightweight health endpoint such as:
/
/health that always returns 200 OK C. Ensure no auth middleware blocks this endpoint.
This is required so Replit does not mark the app as unhealthy and display “Temporary Out of Service”.
5) Restart and stabilization
A. Ensure the app fully restarts after changes
B. Confirm no background crashes or early exits
C. Ensure the app remains running without owner interaction
6) Deliverables (REQUIRED)
A. List all modified files with:
Full file path
Old code (before)
New code (after)
B. Confirm in plain English:
Who can access the app
From where (public internet, any device)
C. Provide a short verification checklist:
Open domain in incognito
Open domain on another phone
Open domain on mobile data
Confirm “Temporary Out of Service” no longer appears
Goal
Ensure the Replit-hosted application is:
Fully public
Accessible via Replit domain
Stable
Not owner-restricted
Not marked unhealthy by Replit
Do not leave any localhost or private binding in place.
