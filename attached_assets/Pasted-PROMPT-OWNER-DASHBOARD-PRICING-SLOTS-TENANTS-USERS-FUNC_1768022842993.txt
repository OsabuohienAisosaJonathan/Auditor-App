PROMPT: OWNER DASHBOARD – PRICING, SLOTS, TENANTS & USERS (FUNCTIONALITY ONLY)
CONTEXT (DO NOT IGNORE)
This is a multi-tenant SaaS.
Owner / Platform Admin controls the platform globally
Tenants (Companies / Auditors) use the tenant application
Tenant users operate only inside their tenant
Owner dashboard is separate from tenant app
Example route: /owner or /platform-admin
Do NOT rebuild pages that already exist
Do NOT move owner controls into tenant app
🎯 OBJECTIVE (UPDATED)
Enhance the existing Owner Dashboard by:
Making Subscription Pricing & Slot controls editable
Making Tenants page fully functional
Making Users page fully functional
Enforcing correct subscription entitlements
Syncing Home page pricing dynamically
A) SUBSCRIPTION PRICING & SLOT CONTROL (OWNER ONLY)
Page: Owner Dashboard → Subscription Plans
This page already exists.
DO NOT rebuild UI — add functionality only.
1. Pricing Control (Editable)
For each plan (Starter, Growth, Business, Enterprise), enable owner to edit:
Monthly Price
Quarterly Price
Yearly Price
Rules:
Pricing must be stored in DB
No hardcoded prices anywhere
Changes must reflect instantly on Home page pricing cards
2. Slot & Capacity Control
Enable owner to configure and lock:
Max Clients / Companies per subscription
Max SRD Department Stores per client
Max Main Stores per client
Max Users (Seats)
Rules:
Enforced server-side
UI must show “Limit Reached”
Owner overrides always win
B) SUBSCRIPTION ENTITLEMENTS (CRITICAL FIX)

D) TENANTS PAGE (EXISTING PAGE – MAKE FUNCTIONAL)
Page: Owner Dashboard → Tenants
This page already exists.
Enable functionality for existing buttons only.
Actions to implement:

Change Subscription Plan
Override Slot Limits
Extend / reduce subscription expiry date
Rules:

E) USERS PAGE (EXISTING PAGE – MAKE FUNCTIONAL)
Page: Owner Dashboard → Users
Enable existing buttons:
Send password reset email
Lock user account
Unlock user account
Force logout (invalidate session)
Delete user
Rules:
Owner actions override tenant admin
Locked users cannot log in
Must work across all tenants
F) SECURITY & SCOPE RULES (STRICT)
Owner routes must remain isolated (/owner/*)
Tenant users must NEVER see:
Pricing editor
Slot controls
Billing overrides
Tenants list
No free trial logic
No payment gateway logic
Do NOT touch:
SR-D Ledger logic
Audit Workspace
Inventory calculations
G) OUTPUT REQUIRED FROM AI BUILDER
List existing pages modified
Show DB fields added/updated
Show entitlement enforcement logic
Confirm Home page pricing is dynamic
Confirm no tenant UI was altered
✅ FINAL RESULT EXPECTED
Owner controls pricing & limits
Tenants & Users pages fully functional
Subscription rules enforced correctly
No duplicated logic
Clean separation between Platform Admin and Tenant App
