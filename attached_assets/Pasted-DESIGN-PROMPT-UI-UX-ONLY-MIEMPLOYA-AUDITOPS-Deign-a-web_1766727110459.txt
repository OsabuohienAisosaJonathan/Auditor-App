DESIGN PROMPT (UI/UX ONLY) — MIEMPLOYA AUDITOPS
Deign a web application called Miemploya AuditOps (Lounge & Restaurant Edition) that can also be viewed on tablet and android. The app is used by Miemploya’s audit team to conduct daily and weekly audit support for clients (lounges/restaurants), including multi-outlet and multi-department sales auditing. Design a modern, professional, audit-grade interface that is web-first, fully mobile responsive, and optimized for fast data capture and evidence-based reporting.
1) Design Goals
1.	Build a boardroom-ready look and feel: clean, trustworthy, finance/audit style.
2.	Prioritize speed and clarity for auditors doing daily/weekly work.
3.	Make it easy to audit clients with multiple outlets and multiple departments (Main Bar, VIP Bar, Kitchen, Outdoor Bar, Events, Rooms, Takeaway).
4.	Every key number must be traceable (evidence and audit trail mindset).
5.	The UI must support two usage modes:
a. POS-heavy clients (CSV/Excel upload import)
b. Manual clients (summary sales entry + optional item-level mode)
2) Information Architecture (Main Navigation)
Create a left sidebar (collapsible) with these sections:
1.	Dashboard
2.	Clients
3.	Audit Workspace
4.	Sales Capture
5.	Inventory & Purchases
6.	Reconciliation
7.	Exceptions (Case Register)
8.	Reports (PDF/Excel)
9.	Settings
10.	Audit Trail (Logs)
Top bar must include:
1.	Client selector (searchable)
2.	Outlet selector (searchable)
3.	Department selector (multi-select optional)
4.	Date picker (Today, Yesterday, Custom Range)
5.	“Generate Report” button
6.	User profile + role badge
3) Core Screens to Design (High Fidelity)
Design each screen with desktop + mobile responsive behavior.
A. Login
1.	Simple login (email/password)
2.	Clean brand space for Miemploya logo
3.	Role-based welcome message after login (Auditor vs Supervisor)
B. Dashboard (Audit Command Center)
Must show:
1.	Today’s audit status overview: “Clients audited / pending / overdue”

3.	Key KPIs: Sales, COGS, Gross Margin, Variance Loss Estimate, Purchases posted, GRNs missing
4.	“Top Risk Departments” list (ranked)
5.	Quick actions:
a. Start Daily Audit

4) Visual Style Guide
1.	Tone: premium, compliant, audit-grade (clean typography, lots of whitespace)
2.	Use a neutral palette with strong contrast for readability.
3.	Alerts should be clear but not noisy:
a. Red = critical
b. Amber = warning
c. Green = normal
4.	Use consistent card layouts, subtle shadows, rounded corners.
5.	Icons should be minimal and professional.
6.	Ensure accessibility: readable font sizes, strong contrast, large tap targets on mobile.
5) Components to Define
Create a reusable design system for:

2.	Filter bars with dropdown selectors
3.	Department summary cards
4.	Tables with sticky headers

6) Critical UX Rules
1.	Always show user context: Client + Outlet + Department + Date at the top.
2.	Never hide discrepancies—surface them early with clear next actions.
3.	Every reconciliation number should have a “source” tooltip (sales import, purchase invoice, count sheet).
4.	Reduce friction: minimal clicks to record daily audit essentials.
5.	Provide “quick duplicate” and “use last settings” options for recurring daily entries.
6.	Keep summary sales mode very easy—this is your default.
7) Deliverables Required from You
Produce:

2.	High-fidelity mockups for all screens listed above (desktop + mobile)
3.	Component library (design system) with states
4.	A clickable prototype flow for Daily Audit:
