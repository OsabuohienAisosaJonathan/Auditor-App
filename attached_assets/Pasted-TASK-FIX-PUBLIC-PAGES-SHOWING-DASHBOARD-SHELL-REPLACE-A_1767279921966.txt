TASK: FIX PUBLIC PAGES SHOWING DASHBOARD SHELL + REPLACE ALL LOGOS WITH OFFICIAL MIAUDITOPS LOGO

IMPORTANT:
- This is NOT a new build. Only adjust what already exists.
- Do NOT break or redesign the SRD ledger logic or any backend routes.
- Fix ONLY layout routing + branding/logo usage.

PART 1 — FIX “GET STARTED / SIGNUP” AND “SIGNUP” PAGES SHOWING DASHBOARD CONTENT
Problem:
- The / (Home / Get Started) and /signup pages are currently wrapped by the main dashboard layout (sidebar/topbar), so they display dashboard navigation/content when they should be public pages.

Required Fix:
A) Create two separate layouts/shells:
1) PublicLayout (NO sidebar, NO dashboard top controls, NO client selector)
   - Used for: Home, About, Contact, Pricing, Login, Signup, Forgot Password, Verify Email screens
2) AppLayout (the existing dashboard layout with sidebar/topbar)
   - Used for: Dashboard pages (Audit Workspace, Inventory Ledger, Reports, Reconciliation, etc.)

B) Routing must enforce:
- Public routes MUST NOT render AppLayout
- App routes MUST render AppLayout
- If an unauthenticated user tries to access App routes, redirect to /login
- If a logged-in user visits /login or /signup, redirect to /dashboard (or the default landing page)

Implementation (choose what matches the codebase):
1) If this is Next.js App Router:
- Use route groups:
  app/(public)/...  -> public pages + app/(public)/layout.tsx
  app/(app)/...     -> protected pages + app/(app)/layout.tsx
- Move current dashboard layout to app/(app)/layout.tsx
- Ensure public pages have their own minimal layout.

2) If React Router:
- Create <PublicLayout /> and <AppLayout />
- Wrap routes accordingly:
  <Route element={<PublicLayout/>}> ...public routes... </Route>
  <Route element={<RequireAuth><AppLayout/></RequireAuth>}> ...protected routes... </Route>

Output requirement:
- Show exact file paths edited
- For each edited file, print first 10–15 lines to confirm correct file
- Provide code patches with clear START/END markers

PART 2 — REPLACE ALL LOGOS WITH OFFICIAL MIAUDITOPS LOGO (LOGO 2)
Problem:
- Different pages/components still show mixed/old/placeholder logos.

Required Fix:
A) Add the official logo assets in ONE place and reuse everywhere.
- Put logo file(s) in a standard location, e.g.:
  client/src/assets/brand/miauditops-logo.jpg (or /public/brand/...)
- Create a reusable component:
  <BrandLogo variant="light|dark" size="sm|md|lg" linkToHome />
- Clicking logo MUST route to the Home page ("/") for public pages,
  and to the dashboard landing page for authenticated users if desired (optional).
  If unsure, always link to "/".

B) Replace logo usage in these areas:
1) Sidebar header logo (AppLayout)
2) Login page card/logo
3) Signup page card/logo
4) Any top header logo area
5) Report preview/export headers if a logo is rendered there

C) Dark sidebar handling:
- Since the logo is on white background (Logo 2), render it inside a white rounded container on dark sidebar:
  e.g. container: bg-white rounded-xl p-2 shadow-sm
- Do NOT invert colors or apply weird filters that ruin branding.

Output requirement:
- List every file where a logo reference was replaced.

PART 3 — QUICK QA CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)
1) Open /signup -> must NOT show sidebar/dashboard menu
2) Open /login -> must NOT show sidebar/dashboard menu
3) Open /about and /contact -> must NOT show sidebar/dashboard menu
4) Open /dashboard (or protected pages) while logged out -> redirect to /login
5) Logo appears correctly on:
   - Sidebar (in white rounded container)
   - Login card
   - Signup card
6) Clicking logo returns to Home ("/") without breaking navigation.

NOTE:
Do not add paid “new features” here — this is only a UI/layout + branding fix for what already exists.
