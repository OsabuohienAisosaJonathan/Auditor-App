MAIN STORE SR-D LEDGER CLEANUP (REMOVE COUNT/VARIANCE COLUMNS + EXPECTED BECOMES CLOSING)

Goal:
Remove these columns from the SRD Main Store Ledger UI and logic:
1) Awaiting Count
2) Variance (Qty)
3) Variance Value (₦)
4) Count Value (₦)

And: “ClosingExpected” should now be the official “Closing” value shown in the table (rename everywhere).

A) UI REMOVAL (MAIN STORE SR-D LEDGER PAGE ONLY)
1) Locate the Main Store SR-D Ledger table component/page and remove:
   - the 4 count/variance-related columns from the table header and body
   - any “Count progress X/Y counted” indicator
   - any “Save Count” button/actions related to AwaitingCount
   - any badges like “Awaiting Count”
2) Remove any data fetching / API calls that exist ONLY to support those removed columns.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT remove stock count features from Audit Workspace or other Count pages.
This task is ONLY: Main Store SR-D Ledger table cleanup.

B) LOGIC CHANGE (EXPECTED -> CLOSING)
1) If code currently uses:
   - closingExpected
   - expectedClosing
   - computedClosing
   Rename the display label AND variable naming to “closing”.
2) Ensure the “closing” value remains computed using the existing ledger math.
3) Do NOT change carry-over logic. Opening should still be derived from previous day closing where applicable.

C) NEW MAIN STORE CLOSING FORMULA (KEEP EXISTING LEDGER BEHAVIOR)
Main Store Closing should remain:

Closing = Opening
        + Added/Purchases
        + Returns (Dept → Main)   [if you already track this]
        - Losses (Waste + Write-off)
        - Total Requisition to Departments (Dep1..Dep10 totals)

Notes:
- Req Dep Total must remain accurate whether Dep columns are expanded/collapsed.
- Loss totals must remain accurate whether loss columns are expanded/collapsed.

D) COLLAPSE / EXPAND MUST STILL WORK (IF IT ALREADY EXISTS)
Keep collapse/expand for:
- Req Dep group (Dep1–Dep10) -> collapsible into Req Dep Total
- Losses group (Waste + Write-off) -> collapsible into Losses Total
Removing count columns must not break table widths or responsiveness.

E) OUTPUT REQUIRED
1) Show exact file paths edited.
2) For each file edited, print the first 10–15 lines to confirm correct file.
3) Provide code patches with clear START/END markers.
4) Provide a short test checklist:
   - Main Store ledger loads
   - Closing displays correctly
   - Collapse/expand still works
   - No missing references to AwaitingCount/Variance variables
